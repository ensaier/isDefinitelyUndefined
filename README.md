# isDefinitelyUndefined
It's a joke inspired by one colleague's code.

Sometimes people write pretty useless code. This library will contain enough useless code to prevent you from writing it. How many other obiuous ways of checking do you know? Feel free to contribute.

## How To Use
1. Include library to your app
2. Use a global variable - function isDefinetelyUndefined
isDefinetelyUndefined(undefined) === true;
isDefinetelyUndefined('lol') === false;
